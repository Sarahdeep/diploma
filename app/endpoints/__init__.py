# This file can be empty or can be used to expose specific 
# functions/variables from the endpoints package if needed.
# Currently, we don't need to expose anything explicitly here
# as main.py imports the specific endpoint modules directly.

# Removed obsolete imports:
# from sqlalchemy import func, or_
# from datetime import datetime, timedelta
# from . import datasets
# from . import map
# from . import classes
# from . import geodata

# You could potentially import the routers here if you wanted 
# main.py to import them from endpoints package directly, e.g.:
# from .species import router as species_router
# from .observations import router as observations_router
# from .habitats import router as habitats_router
# But the current approach in main.py is also fine.

pass # Keep the file non-empty if preferred
